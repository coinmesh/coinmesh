## Running CoinMesh on your local machine

Visit our [documentation site](https://coinmesh.com/docs/#/getting-started) for instructions on getting started.

## Running all tests

Currently to run all of the tests you need to have docker-compose running bitcoind and litecoind, and run lnd locally on your machine using the bitcoind from docker (or your own version of bitcoind running)

Once this is in place you can run all of the tests including the integration tests
