# Getting Started

For now you will need to install a few global NPM dependencies -

```
$ npm install gulp -g
$ npm install jspm -g
```

This is for the build tooling in the client application currently.  We plan  to simplify that process.

Pull down this repository.  Run `npm run recursive-install` in the main directory to install all of the npm packages in all child directories.

Next, you can run the app locally with `npm start` in the root directory.
