# Contributing

## CoinMesh platform

CoinMesh is built through [Dog fooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food).  The platform itself is a CoinMesh application that follows the same architecture principles.

To contribute, follow the instructions for pulling down and running the platform.  Make changes in the relevant directories and PR them back to the master branch of https://github.com/coinmesh/coinmesh.

## Docs

The documentation is currently two separate directories.  This doc for example is located at `/docs/contributing.md`.  Making changes to the docs there will be reflected on the main site.

There is also [API documentation](https://coinmesh.com/docs/api-docs) that describes the various libraries and houses the API documentation.

## Translations

Once i18n is set up in the documentation more information will be provided here to describe how to contribute translations for the documentation.
