# Introduction

Hi.  Welcome to BlockFuse.  We make Litecoin and Bitcoin app development easy.

## The Problem

Application development on top of Litecoin and Bitcoin is notoriously difficult. The amount of protocol level knowledge needed in order to effectively leverage a blockchain client is daunting. Even the documentation for building a blockchain client can be sparse and confusing. This unfortunately becomes a point of frustration for developers which then discourages many from continuing in this industry.

It’s time that we focused on making this process easier. This is the heart behind BlockFuse, a blockchain focused software service startup, and why we created CoinMesh. By providing a platform that automates blockchain nodes and makes it accessible for developers to build their projects on, we hope to open the floodgates of app development to match the exponential growth that LTC and BTC have experienced over these past few years.

## CoinMesh: The Startup Kit for Litecoin and Bitcoin App Development

CoinMesh is a n-tier platform that provides the architecture for developers to create flexible and reusable applications. By automating the blockchain node, we also make it accessible through an adapter layer.  As a developer, you can go straight to building out the foundations of your project in a mere matter of minutes. No more hours of trouble-shooting in the dark.  No more scouring community dicussion boards for answers.  CoinMesh will set an industry standard while simultaneously alleviating the "Talent Crunch" we currently face in this emerging field of technology.

Currently CoinMesh is at an Alpha release and is not intended to use in Production.

## Additional Key Features of CoinMesh

+ OpenSource — CoinMesh is open to the community to be peer-reviewed and so that that the proliferation of application development is unrestricted.
+ JavaScript — As the most popular language, we have strategically chosen JS to leverage its large community.
+ Simple — It will be easy to use with an admin view to help troubleshoot errors as well as the ability to restore your project instantly in case your blockchain client crashes.

## The Current State of the Blockchain Ecosystem and Looking Forward
The necessary infrastructure to support a vibrant and robust Litecoin and Bitcoin economy is nearly complete.  With the advent of SegWit and a rapidly developing Layer 2, we are at the cusp of being able to process thousands of transactions per second.  Also, the financial infrastructure surrounding blockchain has slowly but surely been maturing through exchanges, payment processors, and custodial management services.

+ Exchanges provide an “on” and “off” ramp for retail investors.
+ Payment processors make business logic and fiat sweeps (most of the times) readily available for merchants to accept cryptopayments.
+ Custodial solutions offer security to institutional investors for securely storing large amounts of cryptocurrency. The payoff of this is the removal of the social stigma surrounding cryptocurrency and making it available to different types of investors.

All of these initiatives have been paramount to the success of Litecoin and Bitcoin and will become the architecture that will support the wave of coming applications.  If these three services are like the trunk of a tree, then the applications are its branches.

Therefore, the time to empower application developers with the necessary tools is now. BlockFuse will be at the forefront of this. Let’s work together to build, increase, and sustain an ecosystem that brings utility on top of a censorship resistant future.
